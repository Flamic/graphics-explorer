        <h2 id="fractal" class="block-title">What is fractal?</h2>
        <p>
          In mathematics, a fractal is a subset of Euclidean space with a
          fractal dimension that strictly exceeds its topological dimension.
          Fractals appear the same at different scales, as illustrated in
          successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set. Fractals often
          exhibit similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales, a property
          called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding
          symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as
          in the Menger sponge, it is called affine self-similar. Fractal
          geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          One way that fractals are different from finite geometric figures is
          how they scale. Doubling the edge lengths of a polygon multiplies its
          area by four, which is two (the ratio of the new to the old side
          length) raised to the power of two (the dimension of the space the
          polygon resides in). Likewise, if the radius of a sphere is doubled,
          its volume scales by eight, which is two (the ratio of the new to the
          old radius) to the power of three (the dimension that the sphere
          resides in). However, if a fractal's one-dimensional lengths are all
          doubled, the spatial content of the fractal scales by a power that is
          not necessarily an integer. This power is called the fractal dimension
          of the fractal, and it usually exceeds the fractal's topological
          dimension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Analytically, most fractals are nowhere differentiable. An infinite
          fractal curve can be conceived of as winding through space differently
          from an ordinary line — although it is still topologically
          1-dimensional, its fractal dimension indicates that it also resembles
          a surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The consensus among mathematicians is that theoretical fractals are
          infinitely self-similar, iterated, and detailed mathematical
          constructs having fractal dimensions, of which many examples have been
          formulated and studied. Fractals are not limited to geometric
          patterns, but can also describe processes in time. Fractal patterns
          with various degrees of self-similarity have been rendered or studied
          in visual, physical, and aural media and found in nature, technology,
          art, architecture and law. Fractals are of particular relevance in the
          field of chaos theory because the graphs of most chaotic processes are
          fractals. Many real and model networks have been found to have fractal
          features such as self similarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Images of fractals can be created by fractal generating programs.
          Because of the butterfly effect, a small change in a single variable
          can have an unpredictable outcome.

        <p>
          A color scheme (or model) is an abstract mathematical model describing
          the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers, typically as
          three or four values or color components. When this model is
          associated with a precise description of how the components are to be
          interpreted (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is
          called "color space". This section describes ways in which human color
          vision can be modeled.
        </p>
        <p>
          One can picture this space as a region in three-dimensional Euclidean
          space if one identifies the x, y, and z axes with the stimuli for the
          long-wavelength (L), medium-wavelength (M), and short-wavelength (S)
          light receptors. The origin, (S,M,L) = (0,0,0), corresponds to black.
          White has no definite position in this diagram; rather it is defined
          according to the color temperature or white balance as desired or as
          available from ambient lighting. The human color space is a
          horse-shoe-shaped cone, extending from the origin to, in principle,
          infinity. In practice, the human color receptors will be saturated or
          even be damaged at extremely high light intensities, but such behavior
          is not part of the CIE color space and neither is the changing color
          perception at low light levels. The most saturated colors are located
          at the outer rim of the region, with brighter colors farther removed
          from the origin. As far as the responses of the receptors in the eye
          are concerned, there is no such thing as "brown" or "gray" light. The
          latter color names refer to orange and white light respectively, with
          an intensity that is lower than the light from surrounding areas. One
          can observe this by watching the screen of an overhead projector
          during a meeting: one sees black lettering on a white background, even
          though the "black" has in fact not become darker than the white screen
          on which it is projected before the projector was turned on. The
          "black" areas have not actually become darker but appear "black"
          relative to the higher intensity "white" projected onto the screen
          around it.

        <p>
          The human tristimulus space has the property that additive mixing of
          colors corresponds to the adding of vectors in this space. This makes
          it easy to, for example, describe the possible colors (gamut) that can
          be constructed from the red, green, and blue primaries in a computer
          display.

          Media that transmit light (such as television) use additive color
          mixing with primary colors of red, green, and blue, each of which
          stimulates one of the three types of the eye's color receptors with as
          little stimulation as possible of the other two. This is called "<span
            class="acc-text green"
            >RGB</span
          >" color space. Mixtures of light of these primary colors cover a
          large part of the human color space and thus produce a large part of
          human color experiences. This is why color television sets or color
          computer monitors need only produce mixtures of red, green and blue
          light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other primary colors could in principle be used, but with red, green
          and blue the largest portion of the human color space can be captured.
          Unfortunately there is no exact consensus as to what loci in the
          chromaticity diagram the red, green, and blue colors should have, so
          the same RGB values can give rise to slightly different colors on
          different screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is possible to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by
          combining cyan, magenta, and yellow transparent dyes/inks on a white
          substrate. These are the subtractive primary colors. Often a fourth
          ink, black, is added to improve reproduction of some dark colors. This
          is called the "<span class="acc-text green">CMY</span>" or "<span
            class="acc-text green"
            >CMYK</span
          >" color space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cyan ink absorbs red light but reflects green and blue, the
          magenta ink absorbs green light but reflects red and blue, and the
          yellow ink absorbs blue light but reflects red and green. The white
          substrate reflects the transmitted light back to the viewer. Because
          in practice the CMY inks suitable for printing also reflect a little
          bit of color, making a deep and neutral black impossible, the K (black
          ink) component, usually printed last, is needed to compensate for
          their deficiencies. Use of a separate black ink is also economically
          driven when a lot of black content is expected, e.g. in text media, to
          reduce simultaneous use of the three colored inks. The dyes used in
          traditional color photographic prints and slides are much more
          perfectly transparent, so a K component is normally not needed or used
          in those media.

          <span class="acc-text green">HSL</span> and

          geometries, with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the red
          primary at 0°, passing through the green primary at 120° and the blue
          primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each
          geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the neutral, achromatic,
          or gray colors, ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0, the
          bottom, to white at lightness 1 or value 1, the top.

          Most televisions, computer displays, and projectors produce colors by
          combining red, green, and blue light in varying intensities—the
          so-called RGB additive primary colors. However, the relationship
          between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the
          resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users,
          and for users familiar with subtractive color mixing of paints or
          traditional artists' models based on tints and shades.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an attempt to accommodate more traditional and intuitive color
          mixing models, computer graphics pioneers at PARC and NYIT developed
          the HSV model in the mid-1970s, formally described by Alvy Ray Smith
          in the August 1978 issue of Computer Graphics. In the same issue,
          Joblove and Greenberg described the HSL model—whose dimensions they
          labeled hue, relative chroma, and intensity—and compared it to HSV.
          Their model was based more upon how colors are organized and
          conceptualized in human vision in terms of other color-making
          attributes, such as hue, lightness, and chroma; as well as upon
          traditional color mixing methods—e.g., in painting—that involve mixing
          brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter,
          darker, or less colorful colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following year, 1979, at SIGGRAPH, Tektronix introduced graphics
          terminals using HSL for color designation, and the Computer Graphics
          Standards Committee recommended it in their annual status report.
          These models were useful not only because they were more intuitive
          than raw RGB values, but also because the conversions to and from RGB
          were extremely fast to compute: they could run in real time on the
          hardware of the 1970s. Consequently, these models and similar ones
          have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software
          since then.

          What is affine transformations?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In Euclidean geometry, an affine transformation, or an affinity (from
          the Latin, affinis, "connected with"), is a geometric transformation
          that preserves lines and parallelism (but not necessarily distances
          and angles).
        </p>
        <p>
          More generally, an affine transformation is an automorphism of an
          affine space (Euclidean spaces are specific affine spaces), that is, a
          function which maps an affine space onto itself while preserving both
          the dimension of any affine subspaces (meaning that it sends points to
          points, lines to lines, planes to planes, and so on) and the ratios of
          the lengths of parallel line segments. Consequently, sets of parallel
          affine subspaces remain parallel after an affine transformation. An
          affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between
          lines or distances between points, though it does preserve ratios of
          distances between points lying on a straight line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If X is the point set of an affine space, then every affine
          transformation on X can be represented as the composition of a linear
          transformation on X and a translation of X. Unlike a purely linear
          transformation, an affine transformation need not preserve the origin
          of the affine space. Thus, every linear transformation is affine, but
          not every affine transformation is linear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of affine transformations include
          <span class="acc-text purple"
            >translation, scaling, homothety, similarity, reflection, rotation,
            shear mapping, and compositions of them in any combination and
            sequence</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Viewing an affine space as the complement of a hyperplane at infinity
          of a projective space, the affine transformations are the projective
          transformations of that projective space that leave the hyperplane at
          infinity invariant, restricted to the complement of that hyperplane.

          A generalization of an affine transformation is an affine map (or
          affine homomorphism or affine mapping) between two (potentially
          different) affine spaces over the same field. An affine map is the
          composition of two functions: a translation and a linear map. Ordinary
          vector algebra uses matrix multiplication to represent linear maps,
          and vector addition to represent translations.

        <p>
          Using an augmented matrix and an augmented vector, it is possible to
          represent both the translation and the linear map using a single
          matrix multiplication. The technique requires that all vectors be
          augmented with a "1" at the end, and all matrices be augmented with an
          extra row of zeros at the bottom, an extra column—the translation
          vector—to the right, and a "1" in the lower right corner.
